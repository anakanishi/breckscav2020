Item 85: pokemon-go. No, DEFINITELY not Pok´emon Go. pokemon-go: your programming language that is just a crappy wrapper for Go, where all the keywords are now Pok´emon. It should be at least able to execute your equivalent of `go run`, but we wouldn’t object if it had more functionality. [8 points]

To run a program:
1. Run python3 scav.py
2. Input golem runerigus [go program name].pok

Example programs: hello_world.pok

When writing your new pokemon-go program, please use the following keyword subsitutions:
break -> breloom
default -> dewott
func -> furret
interface -> inteleon
select -> seel
case -> cascoon
defer -> delcatty
go -> golem
map -> marowak
struct -> starly
chan -> chansey
else -> eldegoss
goto -> gothita
package -> burmy
switch -> swirlix
const -> conkeldurr
fallthrough -> falinks
if -> igglybuff
range -> raichu
type -> typhlosion
continue -> corphish
for -> forretress
import -> impidimp
return -> remoraid
var -> vaporeon
