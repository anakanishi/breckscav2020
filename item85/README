Item 85: pokemon-go. No, DEFINITELY not Pok´emon Go. pokemon-go: your programming language that is just a crappy wrapper for Go, where all the keywords are now Pok´emon. It should be at least able to execute your equivalent of `go run`, but we wouldn’t object if it had more functionality. [8 points]

To run a program:
1. Run python3 scav.py
2. Input golem runerigus [go program name].pok

Example programs: hello_world.pok

When writing your new pokemon-go program, please use the following keyword subsitutions:
break -> 
default -> 
func -> furret
interface -> 
select ->
case ->
defer ->
go -> golem
map ->
struct ->
chan ->
else ->
goto -> 
package -> burmy
switch ->
const ->
fallthrough ->
if ->
range ->
type ->
continue ->
for ->
import -> impidimp
return ->
var ->
